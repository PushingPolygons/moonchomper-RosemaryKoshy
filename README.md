# MoonChomper

Credit to Kyle RhÃ´ne for the basis of this game. I've used both his code and his lectues.
Credit to Matt L. for the ideas of varying the attributes of enemies and having R-click do something.

Exported project is in directory `code`. Only Linux and Windows are tested. Windows may be buggy. Both depend on `moonchomper.pck`, the data of the game.
* To run on x86-64 GNU/Linux/X11 with Linux version >= 2.6.24, run `moonchomper.x86_64`
* To run on x86-64 Mac OSX version >= 10.12, unzip `moonchomper.zip` and run `moonchomper.app`
* To run on x86-64 MS Windows Desktop, run `moonchomper.exe`

If that doesn't work, or if you use 32-bit, let me know or fix it yourself: install Godot Engine, a free and open source 2D and 3D game engine  at https://godotengine.org/. You should be able to play the game from the Godot project editor.
